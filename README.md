¡El intérprete que te permite 'programar' en HTML! Ahora puedes unirte a la diversión y decir con orgullo que eres un programador de HTML (más o menos)!

## What is HTML GO?
HTML GO allows you to compile and execute applications in a whole new way. Say goodbye to boring lines of code and embrace a more visual and developer-friendly approach. With HtmlGo, all you have to do is write your code in .html files and let its interpreter, developed in NET 6.0, do the rest.

Yes, you heard it right, programming in HTML! But don't worry, it's not like the HTML you know. HtmlGo offers a unique way to write instructions using the tags and structure of HTML that you're already familiar with. It's like giving a fresh and creative twist to your programming experience.

The HtmlGo interpreter reads your .html file and executes the instructions you've created.

Want to be part of this new way of programming? Join the HtmlGo developer community and discover how this language can bring a fun and refreshing twist to your projects. Say goodbye to monotony and welcome a more visual, creative, and HTML-infused programming experience!
